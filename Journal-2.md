#Journal 2
This is all so far beyond my understanding. I feel like there is a language being used that I do not speak.
I am hoping that as I go forward that the pieces will start to click more. I am so appreciative of the fellow students who are
so kind to explain things very very slowly to me. 
Today I learned to get more comfortable with my Terminal and using git commands. Though, I fear my Terminal window closing, as 
I rely heavily on the history of my commands to double check what I am doing.
