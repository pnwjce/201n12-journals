Had a 2.5 day migraine, missed a Saturday lab day, not helpful to the catch-up process. Monday was a day spent chatting with
multiple natural health folks, trying some new things to deal with the migraines, and so far feeling better, generally. It's 
super helpful to the coding part. The lady village of the cohort has been awesome in making sure I am making progress. 
Really thankful for the gals/and some guys who have been super patient in walking me through the BusMall labs from last week. 
It was nice to know that I had actually made some progress on it beforehand.
