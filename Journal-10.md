# Journal 10
Trying to get my anxiety and migraines in hand. Stressing about getting to the end of the course, and still not getting some 
significant JS concepts. The ladies have all been really helpful/willing to spend time with me on it. Just not getting some of 
the logic stuff. Having a time with the double 'for' loops. Its causing Salmon cookie problems. Hoping to tackle it with Julie
this week.
