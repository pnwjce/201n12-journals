# Journal 8
So I've had both some new highs, and some new lows. I have found that I am good at catching unexpected token stuff, not
necessarily catching if someones logic is off, but still. I also have had a few moments where I could actually show someone 
how to do something, it was kind of fun. But I am also stuck with my Salmon Cookies and I am kind of running away from it. 
So that is no good.
