More difficult...all the terminology has been way more challenging than I thought it would be. I came into this course with 
only Code 101 as my exposure to the word of coding. I expected the actual work to be a challenge, but I didn't realize that 
I would feel like I needed a dictionary for lecture. 
Easier...I had such a hard time with Salmon Cookies, and then when I was sick for the start of BusMall I was so worried. 
But for whatever reason, I was able to get myself rolling and even solve my own errors as I moved through it.
