I really struggle with the Career stuff. I really have no idea where I might fit into the scene. I have only very small, and 
brief, moments of feeling like I get it. So I think/hope that when that happens more, I'll have a better idea of where I want to 
aim my job search. I really feel supported by my AccPartners, but I find the anxiety making it hard to ask for help. Working on
it though. Skyler has been a lifesaver with explaining some of the terminology. It makes it easier to remember stuff if I
actually know what things mean, like understanding "origin" is my computer. Mind blown.
