# Journal 6
I got through Lab 6, I was starting to think stuff was finally making some sense. Then I tried to start Lab 7, and understand-
ing constructor functions has me lost again. I am really fighting the panic as others seem to understand what we are supposed 
to be doing. I am going to go and watch the lecture videos again and see if that helps at all. 
Hard to fight through the confusion.
