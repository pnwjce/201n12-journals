# Journal 9
Who knows if I'm dealing with Imposter Syndrome, or I am just lost in the code, but definitely not feeling confident. I'm at
maybe a 8 on the spectrum. And I have definitely felt that throughout this course. I'm trying to see little things as
progress. Though the pair programming assignment was helpful, in that my partner had to run home in the first hour, leaving me
to start us out. I think I did okay actually. It was pretty basic HTML skeleton setup. Just getting the bones in there. But my
partner, who's more experienced, didn't need to edit it, we were able to just move onto the CSS. So maybe there's hope, and I 
just need to fess up to my AccPartners and ask for help getting unstuck from the Lab 7 SCS stuff.
