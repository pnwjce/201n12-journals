Working through the BusMall labs, trying to get caught up to work on local storage by Saturday. Today was great, in that I had
a few lightbulb moments, and I had multiple times that I was able to figure out the bug in my code. I am feeling a lot more in
control of my coding, and I think some of this is actually sinking in!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
