All I want to do is sleep. I don't know if is looking at a screen more that I have in the last 3 years, but my migraines have 
been out of control. I don't understand how to do 90% of this. Rewatching the lecture videos like they are my coding salvation. 
The videos are way more helpful for me, than lecture live, as Nicholas is a live human and I can't pause him talking and rewind. 
Also, I just can't keep up, typing wise, with him in class. But if I can be coding and pausing, I have had a couple of moments
that seem like very minor breakthroughs.
